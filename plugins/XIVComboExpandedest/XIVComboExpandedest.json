Some new features, some changed ones, a lot of removed ones.\r\n\r\n1.4.1.2:\r\n* Paladin Confiteor Feature returned (but it works differently and much more simply).\r\n* Paladin Royal Authority to Holy Spirit Feature added.\r\n\r\n1.4.1.6:\r\n* Dropping Atonement is now no longer considered a damage gain. Therefore, Royal Authority to Atonement is back on the menu.\r\n\r\n1.4.1.8:\r\n* Royal Authority to Holy Spirit decoupled from combo (still works with it, of course).\r\n* Shield Lob to Holy Spirit added.\r\n* Fight or Flight to Requiescat added.\r\n\r\nIf a recent change isn't documented on this changelog, it is because it doesn't affect plugin functionality, or is a minor bugfix.",
